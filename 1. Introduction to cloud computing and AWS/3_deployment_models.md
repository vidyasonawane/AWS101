### Deployment Model:
- A cloud deployment model represents a specific type of cloud environment, primarily distinguished by ownership, size, and access. 

### Public Cloud:
- A Service provider makes resources, such as applications and storage, available to the general public over the internet.
- Easy and inexpensive set-up because hardware, application and bandwidth costs are covered by the provider.
- No wasted resources because you pay for what you use.

### Private Cloud:
-  offers hosted services to limited number of people behind firewall, so it minimizes the security concerns.
- private cloud gives companies direct control over their data.
- offer more security and compliance support than public clouds

### Hybrid Cloud:
- A cloud computing environment which uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third-party, public cloud services
- It helps you leverage the best of both worlds.

### Community cloud:
- supports multiple organizations sharing computing resources that are part of a community.
- examples include universities cooperating in certain areas of research, or police departments within a county or state sharing computing resources. 
- Access to a community cloud environment is typically restricted to the members of the community.
